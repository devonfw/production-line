* Scroll down to the bottom of the job creation page where you will find the "Pipeline" section. 

** Switch to "Pipeline script from SCM".
** Set "SCM" to "Git".
** Set "Repository URL" to: https://github.com/devonfw/production-line.git
** Credentials can be left empty, because the repository is public.
** Set "Script Path" to the template that you want to use e.g. "devon4j-mts/Jenkinsfile".
